\section{PURPOSE AND SCOPE}
The purpose of this calculation is to design the connections for the \calcproject Project.
\section{METHODOLOGY}
\subsection{Geometry}
Beam shear connections are designed to transfer negligible moments across
joints. The connection may be between beam and beam or between beam and column.
The connection is made using a clip angle that is welded to the connection beam
and bolted on to the supporting member. This detail is chosen because of the
ease with which it can be fabricated and erected. A typical beam to beam shear
connection is shown in figure \ref{fig:shear_conn}.

\subsection{Material Specification}
The material specifications considered for the design of the shear connections
are as shown in the table \ref{tab:mat_spec}.

\end{table}

\subsection{Design Philosophy}
The Shear connections for the piperack are designed in accordance to the 14th
edition AISC specifications. The LRFD method is used.

\section{CALCULATIONS}
The connection design is done using the open source software Osoconn developed
by Roshn Noronha, and available at \url{https://osoconn.com}.


The allowable strenght of an element of the connections is calculated as per
AISC 360 specifications. These values are compared against the required strength
and the ratio between these two are calculated as the interaction ratio. If the
interaction ratio obtained is less that 1.0 then the design is considered
satisfactory.

\begin{equation}
    IR = \frac{R}{R_a}
\end{equation}
where,

\null\quad\quad IR,is the interaction ratio\\
\null\quad\quad \(R\), is the required strength\\
\null\quad\quad \(R_a\), is the allowable strength

The output of the connection design software is provided in attachement 1.
